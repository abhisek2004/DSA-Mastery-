Q-1 : Hello World

This is the very first program in the programming language., this file contains the declaration of print function. print is used to display the message as well as the value on the standard output device (monitor), use of print function is very easy, you have to just pass the string (message) that you want to print on the screen within inverted commas ("message").
Sample Output:

Hello World

 

Program:

print("Hello World")

Q-2 : Hello world with tab

There are few escape sequences which is used for formatting the output in the c programming language, you have to use \t escape sequence in order to provide 4 to 5 spaces between words in the output console. Enter the escape sequence directly into the print statement's within the inverted commas ("mes\tsage").


Sample Output:

Hello World Hello World

 

Program:

print("Hello World Hello World")

Q-3 : Hello world with new line

There are few escape sequences which is used for formatting the output in programming language, you have to use \n escape sequence in order to provide a new line between words in the output console. Enter the escape sequence directly into the print statement's within the inverted commas ("mes\nsage").


Sample Output:

Hello World

Hello World

 

Program:

print("Hello World\nHello World")

Q-4 : Character Input

Python programming has several in-built functions to perform input and output tasks. Two commonly used functions for I/O (Input/Output) are print and raw_input().. Write a program to get a character as input and print it. The raw_input() function reads formatted input from the keyboard. When the user enters a character, it is stored in variable testCharacter. NOTE: Bold letters or words are Input and rest are output statements.

Q-5 : Integer Input

Python programming has several in-built functions to perform input and output tasks. Two commonly used functions for I/O (Input/Output) are print and raw_input(). Write a program to get an integer as input and print it. The raw_input() function reads formatted input from the keyboard. When the user enters an integer, it is stored in variable testInteger. NOTE: Bold letters or words are Input and rest are output statements.

Q-6 : Float Input

Python programming has several in-built functions to perform input and output tasks. Two commonly used functions for I/O (Input/Output) are print and raw_input(). Write a program to get float as input and print it. The raw_input() function reads formatted input from the keyboard. When the user enters a float, it is stored in variable testFloat. Use '%.2f' in the print() to display float value with 2 precisions. NOTE: Bold letters or words are Input and rest are output statements.

Program:

b=math.floor(a*100)/100.0

print(b)

Q-7 : String Input

Python programming has several in-built functions to perform input and output tasks. Two commonly used functions for I/O (Input/Output) are print and raw_input(). Write a program to get the string as input and print it. The raw_input() function reads formatted input from the keyboard. When the user enters a string (i.e) char array, it is stored in variable testString. Format string %s is used in case of string which is an array of character types. Note the '&' sign before testString is not needed, the value will be stored starting from the base address. NOTE: Bold letters or words are Input and rest are output statements.

Q-8 : ASCII Values I

ASCII - American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Write a program to get a character as input and print it's ASCII value. When a character is entered, the character itself is not stored. Instead, a numeric value(ASCII value) is stored. And when we displayed that value using "%c" text format, the entered character is displayed. NOTE: Bold letters or words are Input and rest are output statements.
Sample Input :

G

Sample Output:

103
